// Write an asynchronous function that accepts a message string and a delay time in milliseconds. 
//The function should log the message to the console after the specified delay time.

// You have an array of user IDs and a function getUserData(id) that returns a Promise with user 
//data when given a user ID. Write an asynchronous function that fetches and logs the data for 
//each user ID one by one, in sequence.


// You have an asynchronous function performTask() that returns a Promise. The Promise resolves if
 //the task is successful and rejects if there's an error. Write a function that calls performTask()
  //and logs a custom success message if the task is successful, and a custom error message if there's 
  //an error.
